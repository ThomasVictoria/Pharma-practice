# Pharma Manager
## History
Algolia sales team has been contacted by ARS (regional health agency). ARS technical team exposed their problem. They want a basic search engine that allows them to search a pharmacy by name or by zip code. Moreover, they want to integrate our technology quickly.

Sir Sokol called me and told me "Lionel, you have 3 hours to build a proof of concept".

## Project structure
This project have been built with :

# Techno
Mongo DB
Node.js
Vue.js
Algolia Instant Search

On this project, I have created a small internal API which was written with Node.js  communicate with a front-end Vue.js app.  

You can search by Name or Zipcode. You can click on edit in order to see more information about a specific Pharmacy.
